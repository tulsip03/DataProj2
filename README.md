# analysis

"There was a mean value of 3.1956 and a standard deviation of 0.2181."
"There was a minimum value of 3.0171 and the maximum was 4.0000. The median was 3.1416."
"The distribution shows that the majority of the values are clustered around the known value of Pi of 3.14159"
"Considering the known value of Pi, we can resonably understand why the values lined up where they did and the factor seemed to be chosen at random"
